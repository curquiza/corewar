TO DO ASM
=========
√ check malloc during name and comment parsing
√ test write header to a file (it will be written at the end to include the
  accurate size)
X read the end of the file after the comment of the progran, and join into one big string, we will need all label to parse and encode.
- read line by line and tokenize, we will encode after.
